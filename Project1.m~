  Data description (see http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------

  > These data are the results of a chemical analysis of
    wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three
    different cultivars.
    The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents
    found in each of the three types of wines. 

    Number of Instances
    -------------------
    class 1 -> 59
    class 2 -> 71
 	class 3 -> 48
 
    Number of Attributes - 13
    -------------------------

Classification Lasso

LDA
QDA
Logistic Reg
KNN
GNB
SVM

Model Validation - 
1. ROC - curves
2. Error - 0-1 loss error

Random - forest
